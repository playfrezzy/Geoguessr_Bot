# GeoGuessr Bot

A simple tool that captures a screenshot, crops a defined area, encodes it in Base64, and sends it to the OpenAI ChatGPT API to guess the geographic location.

## Features

- **PyQt5 GUI:** Minimal interface with a single button.
- **Screenshot & Crop:** Uses pyautogui and Pillow.
- **API Integration:** Sends the processed image to ChatGPT for location guessing.

## Usage
### 1. Set Up the API Key:
This bot requires an OpenAI API key to function. Set it as a Windows environment variable by running:

```setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your-api-key"```

Restart your system or open a new terminal for the changes to take effect.

### 2. Run the Application:
Simply launch the ```GeoGuessr Bot.exe``` file. Click the "Take Screenshot and Process" button, and the bot will capture a screenshot, process the image, and send it to the ChatGPT API for location estimation. The result will be displayed in the application window.

### 3. Troubleshooting:

- Ensure your API key is set correctly.
- Check your internet connection.
- If the application doesnâ€™t start, try running it as an administrator.
